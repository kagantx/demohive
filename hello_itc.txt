Three gits for the elven-devs under the sky
Seven for the cobol-programmers in their halls of stone
Nine for c-programmers doomed to segfault
One for the python-lord on his dark throne
In the land of git where the commits lie
One git to rule them all, one ring to find them
One git to commit them all and in the repo bind them
In the land of git where the commits lie
